**Keikaku** is a simple to-do list manager module for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/).
Each user may manage their very own to-do list, being able to create or delete tasks, reorder them, and mark them as complete.

The module adds a button to open the to-do list at the top of the _Journal Directory_ in the sidebar.
